Access the VRE platform at https://jhub-vre.cern.ch!

The Virtual Research Environment is an analysis platform developed at **CERN** serving the needs of scientific communities involved in European Projects. 
Its scope is to facilitate the development of **end-to-end physics workflows**, providing researchers with access to an **infrastructure** and to the digital content necessary to produce and preserve a scientific result in compliance with **FAIR** principles. 
The platform's development is aimed at demonstrating how sciences spanning from High Energy Physics to Astrophysics could benefit from the usage of common technologies, initially born to satisfy CERN’s **exabyte-scale data** management needs. 

The Virtual Research Environment’s main components are:


1. **[AAI](/docs/auth)**: A federated and reliable **Authentication and Authorization** layer 
2. **[The Rucio Data Lake](/docs/rucio)**: A **federated distributed storage** solution, providing functionalities for data injection and replication through a Data Management framework (Rucio) 
3. **[Reana](/docs/reana)**: A **computing** cluster supplying the processing power to run full analyses with Reana, a re-analysis software
4. **[CVMFS](/docs/cvmfs)**: A read-only file system designed to distribute software, and more.
5. **[JupyterHub](/docs/notebook)**: An enhanced **notebook interface** with containerised environments to hide the infrastructure’s complexity from the user.

The deployment of the Virtual Research Environment is open-source and modular, in order to make it easily reproducible by partner institutions; it is publicly accessible and kept up to date by taking advantage of state of the art IT-infrastructure technologies.

## Join the community

#### The ESCAPE Science projects repository
The Science Projects which are using the VRE are described [here](https://escape2020.pages.in2p3.fr/virtual-environment/home/).

#### The VRE coordination meeting
We have a recurrent meeting open to all scientists/researchers/developers interested in the VRE or who are supporting scientific infrastructures.

**What do we discuss:** 
- Latest news and updates on the VRE technical infrastructure and use cases
- Engagement with European projects and funding possibilities
- Design, support, and operation of VREs for communities involved in the ESCAPE Collaboration, and beyond!

See [our meetings agenda](https://indico.cern.ch/category/17065/).
